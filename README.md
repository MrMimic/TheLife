## To do

- Mutations more likely outside of good genes, inside bad ones, base outside of genes
  - Reparation mechanism
  - When a nucleotid is inside a gene defined as "positive", it is less likely to mutate
  - In "negatives" genes, it is more likely to mutate
  - outside genes, base probability

- Mutations more likely in good genes, inside bad ones, base outside of genes
- Reproduction (division) to get more cells
- Cell move regarding the exploitation/exploration trade-offs
- Attraction mechanism between cells when the biome is cool
- Cells cooperation for faster energy extraction
- Sexual reproduction to get more genes with the closest cell

  - Find closest cell
  - If the closest cell is in the same biome, reproduce
